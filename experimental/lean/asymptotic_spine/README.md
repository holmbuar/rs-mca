# Asymptotic Spine (stdlib-only Lean)

This Lean 4 package checks finite arithmetic and combinatorial lemmas used in
the asymptotic Reed–Solomon MCA analysis. It is deliberately stdlib-only and
builds with Lean `v4.31.0`.

## Build

```sh
cd experimental/lean/asymptotic_spine
lake build
```

## Exact adjacent identity scale

`AsymptoticSpine.StaircaseDeep` represents the literal identity-profile scale

```text
I(a) = binom(n,a) / |B|^w,   a = K+w,
```

as an exact natural-number numerator/denominator pair. The adjacent step is
proved without division:

```text
binom(n,a+1) (a+1) = binom(n,a) (n-a),
denominator(w+1) = denominator(w) |B|.
```

Combining these identities gives the cross-multiplied form of

```text
I(a+1) / I(a) = (n-a) / ((a+1)|B|).
```

The same module composes this equality with an adjacent unsafe/safe
certificate, proving that `a+1` is the first safe agreement.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `staircaseBinom_succ_right_eq` | Exact adjacent binomial identity | `lem:exact-adjacent-identity-ratio` |
| `IdentityRawScale.next_numerator_step` | Numerator step from agreement `a` to `a+1` | `lem:exact-adjacent-identity-ratio` |
| `IdentityRawScale.adjacent_ratio_cross` | Cross-multiplied identity-scale ratio | `lem:exact-adjacent-identity-ratio`, equation (AR1) |
| `FrontiersStaircase.adjacent_isFirstSafe` | Adjacent unsafe/safe values pin the first safe agreement | `thm:unconditional-support-envelope-bracket`, adjacent case of (SB3) |
| `FrontiersStaircase.adjacent_identity_ratio_pins_threshold` | Exact ratio together with adjacent threshold pinning | (AR1) and the adjacent case of (SB3) |

## Scope

The exact rational ratio is represented by equality of cross products; the
logarithmic equality in (AR1) is not formalized here. The threshold corollary
assumes the unsafe and safe facts as inputs. Establishing those facts from the
literal lower and upper MCA budgets remains outside this theorem.

The package also contains modules for averaging, moment bounds, Boolean-fiber
arithmetic, profile envelopes, effective closure, rerouting, and the finite
root-incidence core of the deep-regime upper bound. `AsymptoticSpine.lean`
imports the complete package.
